    "1. As a sampling model: we wish to understand a population charateristic (i.e. heights of women in some country), by estimating form that sample.\n",

    "These are conerns that are often (at least should) considered synergistically when it comes to conducteing statisitical inference. Gelman et al. (2019) provide the example of predicting academic scores for students from a pretest using a regression model. In such a study there is sampling of a set of student from the wide array of students with the desire to genralise to the population with the results. There is measuremetn error as no academic test that can give an exact represtnation of a students capacities. there is modle error as the use of say a linear function in a regression is only a approximation of the relationship for test scores."

In the case of standard methods that are assumed to have a gaussian sampling distribution to tale the 95% is to take $\\pm1.96$ SE's with the 68% CI defined by $\\pm1$ SE and the 50% CI taking the $\\pm\\frac{2}{3}$ of a SE.\n",
