    "1. *Validity*. A seemingly obivous one to begin, but the data must be relevant to the research question. It has been ignored though as many questions a researcher maybe interested in may not be directly answerable or simple were not able to be answered by the methods/resources avaible to them. Of course an inconvienent truth. Ideally the outcome mesure should reflect the phenomena of interest, all predcitor vatriable are measured and put into the modle and that the model alos can genralise outside of the study data for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Representativeness* Staitical infernce and thus regression modelling is designed to infer from sample to the hypthetical population. Therefore and discssuion of model coefficents comes with the explicit assupmtion that the poulation is being discussed, therefore, the sample must be representative of the population. Spedifcially the dara must be representative of the distirbtuion of y given the predictor variable imputed into the model.\n",

    "\n",
